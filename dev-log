vdi-sim.py: L517, Sept.07, 2015
I had no idea why I added the "if True:" clause to make all migrations full. Is that because I want to simulate the case of using full migration alone? 
After I commented it out, it does not work any more. there is the assertion errors in L693. 
I need to revert the code to the version that works. Use the github to do so. 
Follow-up: I pulled the commit d91fbf7dcdb028616af80e595cd4f76b54a619df from github, where it worked in 200VM. Yes. it worked. But I saw some bugs in the code. I had no idea whether those are bugs.

TODO: There are two places where I need to change: 
-decide_detailed_migration_plan() function: 
-accounting function
to add the accounting. sorted by source host or dest. host. And sum them up for our accouting. how many pairs. Full or partial.

From the implementation of update_vms, it seems that we always reintegrate the remote partials and turn its current host into its origin host. It will make things worse for these VMs. 
A: I commented out the line that assign the current host as its origin host, and see if things change. The re-integration number should be bigger than before.=> Yes. I verified that. 

After commenting out the line, the overall saving does not change that much. The partial resume# increases. Full migration# increases. 

questions: 1. What is partial resume#? Is it reintegration?
A: resume == reintegration

2. Is there any case we leave the remote partials that are turning into active to run on the current host? 
A: It seems no. How do we handle such cases?

3. Is "partial idle VM# turning into active" number reliable?

4. Is it because we have some migration intevals, so that we have to wait for the migrations to finish? So the simulator does not make the decision right now? There is a lagging behind?
